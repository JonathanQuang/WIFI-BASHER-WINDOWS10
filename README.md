# Wifi-Basher-Windows10
Brute Forcer Forgotten Wifi Passwords

# Purpose
If you have forgotten maybe the last three characters of your wifi password, then this is the tool for you.

Lets say your password is BobRen, but in your head, you only remember Bob***. In the <keyMaterial> of the
XML file, type in Bobaaa

Due to technical limitations and my relatively new entrance to the CS world (I wrote this when I was 17), I could only manage one
password bash per second (slightly over a second anyway)
